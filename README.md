# Interoperability of statistical results between neuroimaging software 

This repository contains the figures used in the paper in which we introduce NIDM-Results viewers for both SPM and FSL, allowing NIDM-Results data to be read and displayed in both environments. The aforementioned viewers are publically available at https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidmresults-spmhtml and https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidmresults-fslhtml respectively.
